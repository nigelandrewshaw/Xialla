    "H4_59": "The biomechanics of an erection",

    "STRONG_65": "To reduce outflow",
    "P_66": ", the corporal tissue (the main part of the penis shaft) squeezes the deep dorsal vein and penile venules of the shaft when the penis is erect, which slows the outflow of blood. ",
    "P_67": "If the inflow through the arteries is faster than the outflow through the veins, an erection can be maintained. But ",
    "STRONG_68": "if the outflow is faster than the inflow, it causes erectile dysfunction (ED).",

    "STRONG_75": " excess blood outflow",
    "P_76": " (venous leakage) a different solution is needed—one that will reduce the outflow of blood that causes erections to lose their power. In this case, drugs are not effective, because they have no effect on outflow. Reducing outflow requires a physical device that constricts the veins and venules of the penis.",
    "H4_77": "Why \"rings\" and other adult toys don't work",
    "P_78": "Many men have tried using a ring—a popular adult toy that is placed at the base of the penis—with little success. Although a ring does constrict the veins of the penis, it can't reduce outflow because it moves during sex, and these movements end up pushing blood out through the veins and diminishing the erection. Even if the ring includes a loop to anchor it to the scrotum, the scrotum also moves and triggers the same outflow effect. ",
    "H4_79": "How is Xialla different?",
    "P_80": "Xialla is engineered to deliver the compression effect of a ring while keeping the mechanism immobilized to prevent subsequent outflow during sex. ",
    "P_81": "A comfortable silicone ring, which encircles the penis and scrotum, is attached to a flexible strap that is drawn back through the legs and attached to a small adhesive tab at the base of the spine.",
    "P_82": "This firm backward pressure keeps Xialla immobile and the pressure consistent under any conditions. The result is a fast forming, firm and long-lasting erection.",
    "H4_83": "Xialla as a complementary therapy",
    "P_84": "For men who have difficulty maintaining an erection, Xialla can provide a solution where pharmaceuticals do not. For those who experience issues with both achieving AND maintaining an erection, Xialla complements drug therapies and offers a complete solution for accelerating the inflow of blood required to achieve an erection and regulating the outflow in order to maintain it longer.  ",

    "BLOCKQUOTE_28": "The current version of Xialla represents V2 of the device and is a significant enhancement in several ways; easier to wear, less obvious visually, more comfortable, less prone to deflection of fixation due to inner thigh fat pads.",

    "P_30": "Finally, the design of the SSOL is less obtrusive to the man and his partner, and does not impact external genitalia of the partner, which may make acceptance as a sexual function (SF) enhancement device for intimacy easier.",

    "DIV_25": "How it works",
    "DIV_26": "Product",
    "DIV_27": "Orders",
    "DIV_28": "Troubleshooting",
    "DIV_29": "How long does shipping take?",
    "P_30": "Shipping usually takes 3-5 business days.",
    "DIV_31": "Does Xialla work with ED medication?",
    "P_32": "Yes, Xialla can be used with ED medication. Erections need 1) blood flowing into the penis and 2) limited blood flowing out. These drugs encourage blood inflow to the penis, while Xialla keeps it there by preventing outflow.",
    "DIV_33": "I've tried everything and nothing works. Can Xialla help me?",
    "P_34": "In clinical trials Xialla was effective at treating 54-66% of men, depending on the severity of their ED. When ED is a result of blood outflow, Xialla is more likely to help.",
    "DIV_35": "Is Xialla tested in clinical trials?",
    "P_36": "Yes. In two separate clinical trials Xialla demonstrated significant benefit to erectile function and sexual enhancement for 54 to 66% of patients, depending on their erectile dysfunction severity.",
    "DIV_37": "What lubricant should I use with Xialla?",
    "P_38": "We recommend a high quality water based or oil based personal lubricant, available in pharmacies or adult stores. You should avoid using silicone lubricants as they react with the silicone of Xialla to gradually soften and expand it.",
    "DIV_39": "How effective is Xialla?",
    "P_40": "Xialla helps 6\/10 men get an erection. It has also been proven effective for difficult to treat cases of ED. Since Xialla helps slow blood outflow (venous leakage) clinical trials showed it to be effective in combination with conventional ED drugs or injections that promote blood inflow.",
    "DIV_41": "What makes Xialla different?",
    "P_42": "Xialla uses a soft, stretchy ring at the base of the penis and a smooth band between your buttocks to attach at the back. This pulls the ring backwards, preventing movement that could allow blood to escape. It's a completely external device- no medications or prescriptions necessary.",
    "DIV_43": "What’s the difference between Xialla and a “cock ring”?",
    "P_44": "Cock rings move back and forth during sex, which allows blood to escape and your erection to fade. Xialla secures the ring in place, preventing blood outflow and helping you maintain a firm long-lasting erection.",
    "DIV_45": "Am I able to orgasm while wearing Xialla?",
    "P_46": "Xialla was designed to improve your erection so that you can have better sex. Xialla won’t impede or prevent your ability to orgasm. If you've tried cock rings and they make ejaculation uncomfortable or impossible, it may be that the rings were too tight. Cock rings need to be tight so they don't move. Xialla doesn't need to be as tight because it's prevented from moving by being held in place against the scrotum\/pubis.",
    "DIV_47": "Will Xialla work for me after a prostatectomy?",
    "P_48": "In clinical trials, Xialla helped 40% of men with a prostatectomy. We recommed consulting your doctor about using medication in combination with Xialla, as this was sometimes required to be successful.",
    "DIV_49": "Does it matter if I’m circumcised?",
    "P_50": "Not at all. Xialla rests at the base of the penis, so circumcision does not have any impact on the use of the device.",
    "DIV_51": "Do I need an erection to start?",
    "P_52": "No. Xialla can actually help you get an erection. As you begin to get stimulated and blood flows into the penis, Xialla helps the erection to build by preventing blood from flowing back out too quickly.",
    "DIV_53": "Can I use a pump with Xialla?",
    "P_54": "Yes, but be sure to use the pump before wearing Xialla. The pump will not work if you are already wearing the device, as the vacuum seal cannot form properly.",
    "DIV_55": "I have a penile implant. Can I still use Xialla?",
    "P_56": "Xialla is a completely external device, so it’s possible that it could still work for you. If you’re unsure, please consult your doctor.",
    "DIV_57": "How does Xialla block blood outflow but not block blood inflow?",
    "P_58": "Xialla targets blood outflow which occurs through veins near the surface of the penis, just under the skin. Blood inflow occurs through arteries that are deep within the penile shaft.",
    "DIV_59": "I can get an erection but it goes away. Can Xialla help?",
    "P_60": "Yes! Xialla works best for men who struggle with excessive blood outflow. Many men can get an erection, but find it difficult to maintain because the blood outflow is too much. Xialla works by preventing blood outflow from the penis so that your erection lasts longer.",
    "DIV_61": "Does Xialla work if you're diabetic or have high blood pressure or heart disease?",
    "P_62": "Xialla might work. These conditions can all contribute to ED by slowing the inflow of blood to the penis and\/or inhibiting the mechanism that prevents excessive blood outflow. While existing therapies enhance blood inflow, there was nothing effective before Xialla that helps prevent blood outflow. Xialla helps prevent excessive blood outflow so it may be of benefit to men with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.",
    "DIV_63": "Is Xialla visible?",
    "P_64": "Xialla has a minimalist design, but it’s not invisible. When it’s on, your partner is able to see the ring at the base of your penis, and if you turn around, they may see the adhesive pad that rests above your buttocks.",
    "DIV_65": "How long can I use Xialla for?",
    "P_66": "You can wear Xialla for as long as it feels comfortable, but we generally recommend 30 minutes. The device will remain in prime condition for 2-4 months depending on level of use. You should consider replacing Xialla every few months for hygienic reasons.",
    "DIV_67": "How do I clean Xialla?",
    "P_68": "It’s super easy- warm water and gentle soap are all you need! Be sure to discard the adhesive pad after each use.",
    "DIV_69": "How often do I have to reorder the Xialla device?",
    "P_70": "Xialla can be used multiple times. We recommend using it for 2-4 months before considering a new one for hygienic reasons.",
    "DIV_71": "Does Xialla come in other colours?",
    "P_72": "For now we exclusively offer a white, semi-translucent device.",
    "DIV_73": "Do I need help putting on Xialla?",
    "P_74": "Xialla is easy to put on by yourself. However, if you have limited mobility and have trouble reaching behind yourself to your lower back, a partner can help.",
    "DIV_75": "Is Xialla packaged discreetly?",
    "P_76": "Yes. Xialla arrives in a plain bubble-pack envelope.",
    "DIV_77": "Is my payment information secure?",
    "P_78": "We use the Shopify checkout platform, so you can be confident that all of your information is 100% protected.",
    "DIV_79": "Where is my order?",
    "P_80": "Use the link in your confirmation email to check in on your order at any time. In the event that we're backordered, we'll let you know the status by email.",
    "DIV_81": "Can my order be expedited?",
    "P_82": "Our shipping is fast, with only 3-5 days between clicking “Order” and delivery to your door. As a result, we do not offer expedited shipping at this time.",
    "DIV_83": "How can I cancel my order?",
    "P_84": "We’re sorry to see you go. Email ",
    "A_85": "help@xialla.com",
    "P_86": " and we will cancel your order. You will also receive a confirmation email from Shopify shortly after.",
    "DIV_87": "What is your refund\/return policy?",
    "P_88": "We offer a total satisfaction refund policy. If Xialla doesn't work for you or you're not satisfied in any way, just contact us at ",
    "A_89": "help@xialla.com",
    "P_90": " and your money will be refunded promptly.",
    "DIV_91": "What payment methods are accepted?",
    "P_92": "We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal.",
    "DIV_93": "How do I order adhesive pads? Are the adhesive pads multiple or one-time use?",
    "P_94": "With your Xialla device order, you receive a starter pack of 10 pads. Each adhesive pad is intended for one-time use.",
    "DIV_95": "Is Xialla covered under my health insurance policy?",
    "P_96": "Xialla isn't currently covered under health insurance.",
    "DIV_97": "Do I need a prescription to order Xialla?",
    "P_98": "No prescription is needed to order Xialla. However if you have medical conditions that could make the use of Xialla unsafe, we advise you to consult with your physician before using Xialla.",
    "DIV_99": "Xialla doesn't help me get an erection.",
    "P_100": "Don’t give up. First, if Xialla isn’t snug around the penis, contact us and we’ll send you a replacement. Second, since Xialla helps control excess blood outflow, clinical trials proved Xialla to be highly effective in combination with therapies that promote blood inflow, including both oral ED medication and injections.",
    "DIV_101": "Xialla doesn't help me get an erection.",
    "P_102": "Don’t give up. First, if Xialla isn’t snug around the penis, contact us and we’ll send you a replacement. Second, since Xialla helps control excess blood outflow, clinical trials proved Xialla to be highly effective in combination with therapies that promote blood inflow, including both oral ED medication and injections.",
    "DIV_103": "The adhesive pad doesn't stick well to my skin.",
    "P_104": "If the adhesive pad comes off, there are a few things you can try. First, make sure Xialla is attached near the bottom of the pad, not in the middle or the top. Second shave the little patch of skin where the pad sticks. Third, ensure the skin is clean and dry before sticking the pad.",
